# Plantix Test

This Application is the test application which is displaying list of names. 

Currently, the list is being loaded from mock data. In real time environment we can load the list using Retrofit and coroutines. Also if we have any images to be loaded then we can use Glide or Picasso to load the images.
For storing the data on local we can use ROOM as a database which is a light weight framework by Android.


# Library Used
Here I have used few Native libraries which Android provided
1. Hilt- Dependency Injection
2. Jetpack Compose- Declarative UI toolkit
3. Kotlin-ktx libraries

# Note
It is recommended to use latest android studio and latest Gradle plugin to run this application. As the project is using all the latest libraries from Android and google.
